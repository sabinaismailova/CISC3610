        I'm Sabina Ismailova. Originally from Uzbekistan, I've been living in
        New York for over a decade. I'm a big fan of Kdramas, and you'll often
        find me engrossed in their captivating stories. I also enjoy listening
        to music and drawing for fun. I love spending time outdoors and hanging
        out with friends who bring positive energy to my life. New York City's
        vibrant atmosphere provides the perfect backdrop for our adventures
        together.
